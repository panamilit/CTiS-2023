                <div class="text-block">
                <p>When it comes to daily AR users, the Pokémon Go app takes the gold. Based on a playing card game that became popular in the '90s, this Nintendo gaming app skyrocketed in popularity when it was released as a free mobile app in 2016. Users simply downloaded the app to hunt for Pokémon characters in their everyday surroundings. The app uses GPS data to determine the user’s location and reveal virtual characters within the reel world. Pokémon Go had 60 million active users in 2017 and accounted for 84 percent of the entire mobile AR consumer spending that year.  

                  Shortly, mainstream video game fans will be able to join their friends in an alternate reality through AR facial recognition and communicate with their teammates through digital puppetry. By reading and analyzing the player’s face, this technology can replicate the player’s body as a character within the game. This will enable users to have a virtual representation of themselves demonstrated in Spielberg’s sci-fi film, “Ready Player One”. </p>

              <div class="text-block">
              <p>AR is revolutionizing video conferencing with advanced facial recognition software used in apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and iPhone FaceTime Memoji. Apple’s developer kit and front camera arrays scan faces with up to 30,000 dots for a secure read, creating detailed virtual representations. This technology allows family members and co-workers to virtually gather in the same room from different locations, enhancing connectivity and reducing travel costs. </p>

            <h4>Collaboration:</h4>
            <div class="text-block">
            <p>VR offers a singular platform for cross-industry collaboration. Imagine a future in which educators and medical professionals collaborate to create patient rehabilitation programs or immersive learning experiences for students. History students may be taken back in time to personally see important historical events, while medical students could practice difficult surgery in a safe, controlled setting thanks to VR simulations. Virtual reality (VR) offers countless opportunities for collaborative content creation, which could completely transform the ways in which humans train, learn, and heal. 
              Beyond the educational and medical fields, VR offers exciting opportunities for collaboration in the retail sector. Retailers can partner with VR developers to create personalized shopping experiences that cater to individual preferences. Customers could virtually try on clothes, walk through life-sized replicas of furniture arrangements in their homes, or even explore different design options for a kitchen renovation – all from the comfort of their living room. This type of collaborative innovation has the potential to transform the retail industry, making shopping more engaging and efficient for consumers. </p>

          <h4>More Efficient and Engaging Shopping:</h4>
          <div class="text-block">
          <p>AR is transforming the shopping experience, making it more efficient and engaging.  Prospective homebuyers can use virtual tour options to view properties from their devices and utilize furniture placement apps like Houzz, Decor Matters, and IKEA Place to visualize furnishing their potential homes. Amazon is also innovating with a “virtual changing room” app that scans body measurements, assesses preferences, and recommends sizes and styles, providing a more accurate depiction of clothing fit and reducing returns. </p>

        <h4>Data-Driven Sports Broadcasting:</h4>
        <div class="text-block">
        <p>AR is widely used in sports broadcasting to enhance viewership by overlaying 3D graphics and interactive visuals on live footage, helping audiences see trajectories, close calls, and record-breaking achievements more clearly. Companies are investing in AR R&D to bring these enhanced viewing experiences to home viewers. Additionally, AR developments are advancing legal e-sports gambling by providing detailed player stats for professional betting. </p>
